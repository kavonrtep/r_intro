# Introduction to GenomicRanges

## What are genomic ranges?

Genomic ranges represent intervals or regions in a genome, defined by:
- A sequence name (chromosome or contig)
- Start and end positions
- Strand information (+ for forward, - for reverse, * for unstranded)
- Additional metadata (e.g., gene names, scores, etc.)

These ranges can represent various genomic features such as genes, exons, transcripts, binding sites, variants, or any other region of interest in a genome.

## Core classes in GenomicRanges

The GenomicRanges package provides three main classes:

1. **GRanges**: Represents a collection of genomic ranges, each with a single start and end location
2. **GRangesList**: Represents groups of genomic ranges, useful for features with hierarchical relationships (e.g., exons grouped by transcript)
3. **GPos**: Represents genomic positions (single points rather than ranges)

## Relationship with Biostrings

While Biostrings handles sequence data (DNA, RNA, protein sequences), GenomicRanges handles genomic coordinates and intervals. The integration between these packages allows you to:
- Extract sequences from specific genomic coordinates
- Analyze sequence content within genomic ranges
- Connect sequence features with genomic annotations

plotGenomicTracks <- function(tracks_list,
                              colors     = NULL,
                              chromosome = NULL,
                              from       = NULL,
                              to         = NULL) {
  # Validate inputs
  n <- length(tracks_list)
  if (is.null(names(tracks_list)) || any(names(tracks_list) == "")) {
    stop("tracks_list must be a named list (names used as track titles).")
  }
  if (!is.null(colors) && length(colors) != n) {
    stop("If colors is provided, its length must equal number of tracks.")
  }

  # Default colors to gray
  if (is.null(colors)) {
    colors <- rep("gray", n)
  }

  # Build AnnotationTrack for each element, adding feature IDs only if defined
  annotation_tracks <- mapply(function(gr, col, nm) {
    # Prepare base arguments
    args <- list(
      range    = gr,
      name     = nm,
      fill     = col,
      col      = "black",      # border color
      stacking = "dense"       # compact stacking
    )
    # Add feature IDs if 'id' metadata column exists and is non-empty
    if ("id" %in% names(mcols(gr))) {
      ids <- mcols(gr)$id
      if (!all(is.na(ids)) && length(ids) == length(gr)) {
        args$showFeatureId     <- TRUE
        args$featureAnnotation <- "id"
        # Optionally customize label appearance
        args$fontcolor.feature <- "black"

    }
    do.call(AnnotationTrack, args)

  # Add genome axis

  # Combine and plot
  all_tracks <- c(list(axis_track), annotation_tracks)
  plotTracks(all_tracks,
             chromosome       = chromosome,
             from             = from,

## Creating GRanges Objects

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Create a simple GRanges object
gr <- GRanges(
  seqnames = c("chr1", "chr2", "chr2", "chr1", "chr3"),
  ranges = IRanges(start = c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30), end = c(20, 25, 30, 35, 40)),
  strand = c("+", "-", "+", "*", "-"),
  score = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25),
  GC = c(0.45, 0.55, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80)
)

# Display the GRanges object
gr

# Examine the structure
str(gr)
```

The output will show a GRanges object with 5 ranges and 2 metadata columns (score and GC). The genomic coordinates (seqnames, ranges, and strand) are displayed on the left, and the metadata columns are on the right.

## Accessing GRanges Components

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Access the sequence names (chromosomes)
seqnames(gr)

# Access the ranges (start and end positions)
ranges(gr)

# Access the strand information
strand(gr)

# Access metadata columns
mcols(gr)

# Access a specific metadata column
gr$score

# Get the width of each range
width(gr)

# Get the number of ranges
length(gr)
```

## Subsetting GRanges Objects

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Subset by index
gr[1:3]

# Subset by logical vector
gr[width(gr) > 10]

# Subset by chromosome
gr[seqnames(gr) == "chr1"]

# Subset by strand
gr[strand(gr) == "+"]

# Subset by metadata
gr[gr$score > 10]

# Subset by multiple conditions
gr[seqnames(gr) == "chr2" & strand(gr) == "+"]
```

## Basic Range Operations

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Shift ranges by 5 base pairs  (--> start + 5, end + 5)
shift(gr, 5)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, shifted=shift(gr, 5)))


# Resize ranges to a width of 10 bp (start is unchanged - default)
resize(gr, width = 10)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, resized=resize(gr, width = 10)))

# Resize ranges to a width of 10 bp, anchoring at the start
resize(gr, width = 10, fix = "start")
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, resized=resize(gr, width = 10, fix = "start")))

# Resize ranges to a width of 10 bp, anchoring at the end
resize(gr, width = 10, fix = "end")
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, resized=resize(gr, width = 10, fix = "end")))

# Narrow ranges by trimming from both ends
narrow(gr, start = 2, end = -2)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, narrow=narrow(gr, start = 2, end = -2)))

# Expand ranges by 5 bp on each side of the start coordinate
flank(gr, width = 5, both = TRUE)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, expanded=flank(gr, width = 5, both = TRUE)))

# Get the 5' flanking region
flank(gr, width = 5, start = TRUE)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, five_prime_flank=flank(gr, width = 5, start = TRUE)))

# Get the 3' flanking region
flank(gr, width = 5, start = FALSE)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, three_prime_flank=flank(gr, width = 5, start = FALSE)))

# Restrict ranges to a specific region (e.g., positions 15 to 30)
restrict(gr, start = 15, end = 30)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr=gr, restricted=restrict(gr, start = 15, end = 30)))
```

# Interval Operations


## Finding Overlaps Between Ranges
The **GenomicRanges**  package provides efficient containers and methods for representing and manipulating genomic intervals, with a focus on overlap operations that are foundational in many bioinformatics analyses. Overlap‐finding functions return a **Hits**  object that encodes the relationships between two sets of ranges, enabling you to extract matching indices, count overlaps, and subset ranges based on their overlap patterns. Key functions include:

- **`findOverlaps()`** : identifies all overlapping pairs between two `GRanges` objects.
- **`queryHits()`**  / `subjectHits()`** : extract the query and subject indices from a `Hits` object, respectively.
- **`countOverlaps()`** : for each range in one set, counts how many ranges in the other set overlap it.
- **`subsetByOverlaps()`** : returns the subset of ranges that overlap any range in another set.
- **`overlapsAny()`** : a logical vector indicating which ranges have at least one overlap in the other set.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Create a second GRanges object
gr1 <- GRanges("chr1", IRanges(c(5, 80, 329), width=20), id=1:3)
gr2 <- GRanges("chr1", IRanges(c(10, 100, 300), width=15), id=1:3)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr1=gr1, gr2=gr2))

# Find all overlapping pairs
hits <- findOverlaps(gr1, gr2)
hits
# Once you have a **Hits**  object, `queryHits(hits)` returns the indices in
# the **query**  (`gr1`) and `subjectHits(hits)` returns the indices in
# the **subject**  (`gr2`) for each overlapping pair
# Indices of overlapping ranges
q_idx <- queryHits(hits)    # c(1, 3)
s_idx <- subjectHits(hits)  # c(1, 3)

# Access the actual ranges
gr1[q_idx]
gr2[s_idx]

# Count overlaps of gr1 against gr2
counts <- countOverlaps(gr1, gr2)
counts

gr1_overlapping <- subsetByOverlaps(gr1, gr2)
gr1_overlapping
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr1=gr1, gr2=gr2, gr1_overlapping=gr1_overlapping))

# pairwise overlap comparison
has_overlap <- overlapsAny(gr1, gr2)
has_overlap
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr1=gr1, gr2=gr2))



```

## Nearest Neighbor Operations

Nearest‐neighbor operations in the **GenomicRanges**  package allow you to query the closest or adjacent genomic intervals between two sets of ranges using functions like `nearest()`, `distance()`, `precede()`, and `follow()`. Each of these functions returns integer indices (or a `Hits` object) indicating which ranges in a “subject” set relate to each range in a “query” set, enabling you to quickly locate the closest overlap or upstream/downstream neighbor.

1. `nearest()`
The `nearest(x, subject, select="first", ignore.strand=FALSE)` function finds, for each range in **x** , the index of the closest range in **subject**  (ties broken arbitrarily). If **subject**  is omitted, **x**  is used as both query and subject, so each range’s nearest neighbor in the same set is returned (excluding itself when `select="first"`)
2. `distance()`
The `distance(x, y)` function computes the signed distance between each range in **x**  and the corresponding range in **y** , recycling shorter objects as needed. A distance of 0 indicates overlap; positive values indicate separation; negative values can occur for zero‐width ranges or self‐distance in certain contexts.
3. `precede()`
`precede(x, subject, select="first", ignore.strand=FALSE)` returns, for each range in **x** , the index of the nearest range in **subject**  that falls entirely **before**  it (i.e., with end < start of x). This lets you identify upstream neighbors on the same chromosome and strand (unless `ignore.strand=TRUE`).
4. `follow()`
`follow(x, subject, select="first", ignore.strand=FALSE)` returns, for each range in **x** , the index of the nearest range in **subject**  that falls entirely **after**  it (i.e., with start > end of x) . This identifies downstream neighbors on the same chromosome/strand by default.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Find the nearest range in gr2 for each range in gr

query   <- GRanges("chr1", IRanges(c(10, 20, 50), width=5))
subject <- GRanges("chr1", IRanges(c(1, 15, 40, 70), width=5))

# Find nearest subject range for each query range
hits_nearest <- nearest(query, subject)
hits_nearest
plotGenomicTracks(list(query=query, subject=subject))
distances <- distance(query, subject[1:3])
distances

# Find preceding subject range for each query range - look for downstream neighbors
hits_precede <- precede(query, subject)
hits_precede



# Find the following range - look for upstream neighbors
hits_follow <- follow(query, subject)
hits_follow


# more examples
subject <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges   = IRanges(start = c(5, 20, 40), width = 5),
  strand   = c("+", "-", "+"),
  id = 1:3
)
# Query: 4 ranges on chr1 with mixed strands
query <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges   = IRanges(start = c(1, 15, 30, 50), width = 5),
  strand   = c("+", "-", "*", "-"),
  id = 1:4
)
plotGenomicTracks(list(query=query, subject=subject))
hits_precede <- precede(query, subject)
hits_precede
hits_follow <- follow(query, subject)
hits_follow
```
Orientation and strand for precede and follow: Orientation is 5’ to 3’, consistent with the direction of translation. Because positional numbering along a chromosome is from left to right
and transcription takes place from 5’ to 3’, precede and follow can appear to have ‘opposite’
behavior on the + and - strand. Using positions 5 and 6 as an example, 5 precedes 6 on the +
strand but follows 6 on the - strand.
The table below outlines the orientation when ranges on different strands are compared. In
general, a feature on * is considered to belong to both strands. The single exception is when
both x and subject are * in which case both are treated as +.

|  x  | subject | orientation                                               |
| :-: | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
|  +  |    +    | --->                                                      |
|  +  |    -    | NA                                                        |
|  +  |    \*   | --->                                                      |
|  -  |    +    | NA                                                        |
|  -  |    -    | <---                                                      |
|  -  |    \*   | <---                                                      |
|  \* |    +    | --->                                                      |
|  \* |    -    | <---                                                      |
|  \* |    \*   | ---> (the only situation where `*` arbitrarily means `+`) |

## Set Operations on Ranges

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Create two more GRanges objects for set operations
gr_a <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(start = c(10, 20, 30), end = c(15, 25, 35))
)

gr_b <- GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges(start = c(12, 22, 40), end = c(17, 27, 45))
)

# Union of ranges
union(gr_a, gr_b)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr_a=gr_a, gr_b=gr_b, union=union(gr_a, gr_b)))



# Intersection of ranges
intersect(gr_a, gr_b)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr_a=gr_a, gr_b=gr_b, intersect=intersect(gr_a, gr_b)))

# Difference of ranges (ranges in gr_a that don't overlap with gr_b)
setdiff(gr_a, gr_b)
plotGenomicTracks(list(gr_a=gr_a, gr_b=gr_b, setdiff=setdiff(gr_a, gr_b)))
```

# Working with GRangesList

GRangesList objects are useful for representing hierarchical relationships, such as exons grouped by transcript or peaks grouped by sample.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Create a GRangesList
grl <- GRangesList(
  sample1 = GRanges(
    seqnames = c("chr1", "chr2"),
    ranges = IRanges(start = c(10, 20), end = c(20, 30))
  ),
  sample2 = GRanges(
    seqnames = c("chr1", "chr3"),
    ranges = IRanges(start = c(15, 40), end = c(25, 50))
  )
)

# Display the GRangesList
grl

# Access elements of the list
grl[[1]]
grl$sample2

# Get the length of each element
elementNROWS(grl)

# Unlist to get a single GRanges object
unlist(grl)

# Apply operations to each element
endoapply(grl, shift, 5)
```

# Integration with Biostrings

One of the  features of GenomicRanges is its integration with Biostrings, allowing you to extract and analyze sequences from genomic coordinates.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
# Load required packages
library(Biostrings)
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)

# Create a GRanges object for some genes
genes <- GRanges(
  seqnames = c("chr1", "chr2"),
  ranges = IRanges(start = c(10000, 20000), end = c(10500, 20500)),
  strand = c("+", "-"),
  gene_id = c("gene1", "gene2")
)

# Extract DNA sequences for these regions
# Note: In a real lesson, we would use actual genomic coordinates
# This is just a demonstration of the syntax
gene_seqs <- getSeq(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38, genes)
names(gene_seqs) <- genes$gene_id
print(gene_seqs)

gc_content <- letterFrequency(gene_seqs, "GC", as.prob = TRUE)
print(gc_content)

```
