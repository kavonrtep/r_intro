## Follow-Up Assignment: Advanced Visualization with ChickWeight Data 


### Overview 

In this assignment, you will extend your previous work with the **ChickWeight**  dataset (Assignment_1). You will create advanced visualizations by generating a multiplot layout and a single plot that distinguishes groups through color. Finally, you will export your plots to PDF files. Submit your R script and the resulting image files.

### Task 1: Create a Multiplot Layout 

 
2. **Multiplot Layout:** 

  - Create a multiplot that displays separate scatter plots of chick weight over time for each diet type.
   - Use either `par()` or `layout()` to arrange the plots.

---



### Task 2: Create a Single Plot Using Colored Groups 

 
2. **Single Plot with Colored Groups:** 
 
  - Create a single scatter plot of chick weight versus time using the entire **ChickWeight**  dataset.
  - Differentiate the points by diet using distinct colors.
  - Include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to each diet.

### Task 3: Exporting the Plots to PDF 

 
2. **Export Plots:** 

  - Export your multiplot and your single colored plot as separate PDF files.

### Submission 

 
- **Script File:** 
- **Image Files:** 

Submit the PDF files of both the multiplot and the single colored plot.
 
- **Instructions:** 

  - Ensure your script runs without errors.
  - Verify that each task produces the expected output.
  - Email your R script and the PDF image files as instructed.
